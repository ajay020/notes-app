    <string name="place_holder_text">If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life\nthen let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight\n—let me not forget for a moment,\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\nand in my wakeful hours.\nAs my days pass in the crowded market of this world\nand my hands grow full with the daily profits,\nlet me ever feel that I have gained nothing\n—let me not forget for a moment,\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\nand in my wakeful hours.\nWhen I sit by the roadside, tired and panting,\nwhen I spread my bed low in the dust,\nlet me ever feel that the long journey is still before me\n—let me not forget a moment,\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\nand in my wakeful hours.\nWhen my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound\nand the laughter there is loud,\nlet me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house\n—let me not forget for a moment,\nlet me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams\nand in my wakeful hours\n\n-Rabindranath Tagore</string>
